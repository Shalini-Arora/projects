Map Task:
Also on the map 1. it does not show the locations on the map. 2. For the charts - we simply need a count no chart is required 3. The font on the header is different. 4. I thought the map was going to be more simple with with pins and maybe an outline of the counties and regions.

We also may need an additional field in the table "Status" - this is something that we will need to administer on the backend to show if they are In Progress, Approved, Online,

how difficult would it be (in hours) to show a map of Iowa with a table below showing a list of agencies that have applied. The fields in the table would be Region-County-Agency. This information would be based on the registration process. We would also need a way to select which registered users would be on the map. Maybe a field for level and a check box to post to map.


Ok - I will need the map of Iowa in sections like the sample I provided. Sample page https://isicsb.iowa.gov/iowa-homeland-security-regions - then I will want the count by region and a pin in each area on the map. Can you still perform this work?

The design should not same as sample because Google map api have own map and layout structure. I can show mark the list of regions and then point the pins. Please let me know

if possible make sure you can delineate the 6 regions on the map
